# Zat-s-CSGO-Simple-internal-hack

This solution does NOT contain any binaries which you can actually inject into the game.
You'll have to either compile the binaries on your own or download them from here:
http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/139216-zats-simple-internal-radar-and-glow.html

The link above contains additional information about this project, including screenshots!

After you got the binaries, pick any injector and inject the DLL into the game AFTER the game fully loaded and shows the menu-screen!
